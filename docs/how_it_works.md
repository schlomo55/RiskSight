# How the Risk Processing System Works

## Overview - What Does This System Do?

The Risk Processing API is like a smart calculator that helps evaluate how risky different locations might be. Just like how you might consider multiple factors when deciding whether to walk through a neighborhood at night (crime rates, lighting, weather, etc.), this system looks at several risk indicators and combines them into a single, easy-to-understand risk score.

**Think of it like this**: If you were planning to move to a new city, you'd want to know about crime rates, accident statistics, the economic situation, and even how weather might affect daily life. Instead of juggling all these different pieces of information, our system takes all these factors, processes them intelligently, and gives you one number (0-100) that summarizes the overall risk level.

## The Four Key Risk Factors

### 1. Crime Index (0-10 scale)
**What it means**: How much crime happens in this area  
**Real-world example**: A quiet suburban neighborhood might have a crime index of 2, while a high-crime urban area might score 8 or 9  
**How we use it**: Higher crime = higher risk score

### 2. Accident Rate (0-10 scale)
**What it means**: How often accidents (traffic, workplace, etc.) occur  
**Real-world example**: A busy highway intersection might have an accident rate of 7, while a quiet residential street might score 2  
**How we use it**: More accidents = higher risk score

### 3. Socioeconomic Level (1-10 scale)
**What it means**: The economic stability and prosperity of the area  
**Real-world example**: A wealthy suburb might score 9, while an economically disadvantaged area might score 3  
**How we use it**: Lower socioeconomic level = higher risk (this is inverted - poverty increases risk)

### 4. Weather Conditions (Categories)
**What it means**: Current or typical weather conditions that might affect safety  
**The categories we recognize**:
- **Clear** (lowest risk): Sunny, calm conditions
- **Rainy** (moderate risk): Wet roads, reduced visibility
- **Snowy** (higher risk): Slippery conditions, difficult travel
- **Stormy** (high risk): High winds, potential for damage
- **Extreme** (highest risk): Severe weather events like hurricanes or blizzards

## How the System Processes This Information

### Step 1: Input Validation
Before doing any calculations, the system acts like a careful librarian, checking that all the information makes sense:
- Are the numbers within the expected ranges?
- Is the weather condition one we recognize?
- Are all required pieces of information provided?

**Example**: If someone enters a crime index of 15 (but our scale only goes to 10), the system will reject this and ask for correct information.

### Step 2: Normalization
Different risk factors use different scales, so we need to make them comparable. It's like converting different currencies to the same currency before adding them up.

**How we normalize**:
- **Crime Index**: 7 out of 10 becomes 70%
- **Accident Rate**: 6 out of 10 becomes 60%  
- **Socioeconomic Level**: 3 out of 10 becomes 80% risk (inverted - lower prosperity = higher risk)
- **Weather**: "Stormy" becomes 90% based on our predefined risk levels

### Step 3: Weighted Combination
Not all risk factors are equally important, so we apply weights (like importance percentages):
- Crime Index: 30% of the total score
- Accident Rate: 25% of the total score
- Socioeconomic Level: 25% of the total score
- Weather: 20% of the total score

**Example Calculation**:
```
Base Score = (70% × 0.30) + (60% × 0.25) + (80% × 0.25) + (90% × 0.20)
Base Score = 21 + 15 + 20 + 18 = 74%
```

### Step 4: Smart Amplification Rules
Sometimes, combinations of factors make situations riskier than you'd expect. Our system includes "amplification rules" that boost the risk score when dangerous combinations occur.

**Current amplification rules**:
1. **High Crime + Bad Weather**: If crime is above 7 AND weather is Stormy or Snowy → multiply by 1.15
2. **High Accidents + Low Economy**: If accidents are above 8 AND socioeconomic level is below 3 → multiply by 1.10

**Example**: If our base score of 74% triggers the first rule:
```
Final Score = 74% × 1.15 = 85.1%
```

### Step 5: Final Output
The system gives you:
- **Overall Risk Score** (0-100): Easy-to-understand final number
- **Component Breakdown**: Shows how each factor contributed
- **Transparency**: Logs which rules were applied and why

## Real-World Example Walkthrough

Let's say you're evaluating the risk for **Downtown Portland on a stormy day**:

### Input Data:
- **City**: Portland
- **Crime Index**: 8 (high urban crime)
- **Accident Rate**: 6 (moderate traffic accidents)
- **Socioeconomic Level**: 5 (middle-class area)
- **Weather**: Stormy

### Processing Steps:

1. **Validation**: ✅ All values are within acceptable ranges
2. **Normalization**:
   - Crime: 8/10 = 80%
   - Accidents: 6/10 = 60%
   - Socioeconomic: (11-5)/9 = 67% risk
   - Weather: "Stormy" = 90%

3. **Weighted Combination**:
   ```
   Base = (80% × 0.30) + (60% × 0.25) + (67% × 0.25) + (90% × 0.20)
   Base = 24 + 15 + 16.75 + 18 = 73.75%
   ```

4. **Amplification Check**:
   - Crime (8) > 7? ✅ Yes
   - Weather is Stormy? ✅ Yes
   - **Rule triggered**: Multiply by 1.15
   ```
   Amplified = 73.75% × 1.15 = 84.8%
   ```

5. **Final Result**:
   ```json
   {
     "city": "Portland",
     "risk_score": 84.8,
     "components": {
       "crime_component": 80.0,
       "accident_component": 60.0,
       "socioeconomic_component": 66.7,
       "weather_component": 90.0
     }
   }
   ```

### What This Means:
- **84.8/100**: High risk situation
- **Main contributors**: High crime (80) and stormy weather (90)
- **Amplification applied**: The combination of high crime + bad weather made it even riskier
- **Actionable insight**: Maybe postpone non-essential activities in this area during the storm

## Understanding the Results

### Risk Score Interpretation
- **0-25**: Low Risk (Green) - Generally safe conditions
- **26-50**: Moderate Risk (Yellow) - Some caution advised
- **51-75**: High Risk (Orange) - Significant precautions needed
- **76-100**: Very High Risk (Red) - Consider avoiding or postponing

### Component Analysis
Always look at the component breakdown to understand **why** a score is high or low:

**Example 1**: Risk Score 85
- Crime: 95 (very high)
- Accidents: 40 (moderate) 
- Economy: 90 (poor)
- Weather: 20 (clear)

**Insight**: The high risk is mainly due to crime and economic factors, not weather.

**Example 2**: Risk Score 85
- Crime: 30 (low)
- Accidents: 95 (very high)
- Economy: 40 (moderate)
- Weather: 95 (extreme weather)

**Insight**: Same total risk, but caused by accidents and weather - very different situation requiring different precautions.
